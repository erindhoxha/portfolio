          <p class="small">Tourism New Zealand is the organisation responsible for marketing
                New Zealand to the world as a tourist destination. The
                major tool we use to do this is the 100% Pure New Zealand
                marketing campaign, a campaign that has evolved over the
                past two decades to make New Zealand one of the world's
                most well-respected tourism brands.
            </p>
                <p class="small"> International tourism has grown to become New Zealand's
                largest earner of foreign exchange, pumping around NZD14.5
                billion annually into the nation's economy. Over 3.7 million
                visitors arrive in the country every year. (updated December
                2017)</p>

          <p class="small">Web designing a single page web application, which is
                responsive for all type of devices, they have a new campaign
                that is aimed at visitors staying for short periods, booking their
                own accommodation and arranging their own transport.
                A single page web application which allows users to input information,
                and provide feedback with Accommodation or
                Transport options, calculating their cost and displaying the
                price and a payment option.</p>
                <p class="small">For this project we’ve chosen to do Transport and Accommodation
                to help their needs in one go, so they can book their
                vehicle & the place of stay within one website.</p>

            <p class="small">By the result of the search of user researching for Tourism New
                    Zealand I’ve found out that mostly users from overseas
                    will be using this app, and their language varies from
                    place to place.</p>
            <p class="small">People aged 18 to 33 - 80%</p>
            <p class="small">People ages 33+ - 20%</p>
            <p class="small">The stats are important when pre-developing the project since
                    it gives an overview of the age group and the type of users
                    which will interact with it.
                    Overseas visitor arrivals are increased by 9 percent since 2015.
                    New Zealand is known for beautiful places to visit, and mostly
                    backpackers will use the website, so for that matter the website
                    is responsive for Mobile, Tablets and Desktop, and every file

                  SWOT Analysis
              </h1>
                <h5>Strengths</h5>
                <p class="small">Tourism New Zealand is a highly valuable website & has
                a great brand and trust since it’s connected with the government,
                which allows users to book & shop freely without
                stress.</p>
                <h5>Weaknesses</h5>
                <p class="small">Weakness of Tourism New Zealand is that the competition
                of the other companies are focused for this campaign’s needs,
                which causes a problem for other customers to shift between
                other websites and Tourism New Zealand’s one.</p>
                <h3>Opportunities</h3>
                <p class="small">Opportunities of Tourim New Zealand are extendable to a
                grade which not only the company is responsible for the NZ
                tourism but can offer many of the cheapest and best
                accommodation and transport for their customers.</p>
                <h3>Threats</h3>
                <p class="small">As New Zealand has bus tours and they offer accommodation
                and transport within the same package, some travellers
                especially backpackers might choose those companies to
                travel, because of the safe way to book everything at once.</p>

                            so the only way to make their competition level lower was
                            to make it more about New Zealand and make it that way that
                            people from other countries can change their language, which
                            House of Travel doesn’t have. </p>

                            They have stores New Zealand wide, and have newsletters
                            which lets them subscribe and get offers and deals by this company.</p>
